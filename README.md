Project - Iris data set

Background
Ronald Fisher was a statistician and a biologist, he published a paper based on the data in 1936: ‘The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discrimination.’ This data set contains 150 measurements, with no missing values. It consists of the morphologic properties of three related iris species. There are 50 samples of each species, and for each four measurements were recorded: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width and class of iris (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set.)

To explore this dataset, first we look at the descriptive statistics so we understand the data better. Next we want to visualise the data so that we can see the spread of the data and if we have any outliers. The aim of this analysis is to discover if there is any correlation between sepal six=za and petal size and to discover if there is a significant difference in the size of the sepal and petals between the three classes of iris
