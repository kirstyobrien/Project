Project - Iris data set

Background
Ronald Fisher was a statistician and a biologist, he published a paper based on the data in 1936: ‘The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discrimination.’ This data set contains 150 measurements, with no missing values. It consists of the morphologic properties of three related iris species. There are 50 samples of each species, and for each four measurements were recorded: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width and class of iris (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set.)
